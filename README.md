Code to run tracking simulations

This repository contains the code that was updated to run FCC tracking simulations.

It contains the directories:

- SixTrack: SixTrack code updated to include efficiencies vs. dp/p and 2D efficiencies (in A_r and dp/p). Other minor changes also included - see changelog

- BeamLossPattern: small change to use the ring lenght of the FCC. The lenght of the ring is now read in from the twiss file, instead of being hard coded.
